# ACNN-6mA
key word: N6 Methyladenine site prediction, methylation site prediction, deep learning, machine learning


ACNN-6mA is first pre-trained on rice data sets, and then fine-tuned on each data set. The results show that ACNN-6mA can achieve high performance in single species independent verification set or multi-species cross-species prediction
